      "As the sun set over the small village, a young girl named Luna sat on a bench outside her family's bakery, watching the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky. She had spent the day helping her mother mix and knead dough for the evening's bread, and now she was content to simply sit and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of the quiet village. But as she gazed up at the stars, Luna noticed a small, delicate music box tucked away among the bakery's displays, its lid closed over a soft, golden melody that seemed to match the rhythm of her own heartbeat. Without thinking, she lifted the lid, and the music swirled out into the night air, beckoning in a group of fireflies who danced and fluttered around Luna like tiny ballerinas, their lights shimmering in time with the music box's gentle song."
